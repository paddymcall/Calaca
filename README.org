#+TITLE: Calaca for SARIT

This is an adaptation of [[https://github.com/romansanchez/Calaca][Calaca]] to search the [[https://github.com/sarit/SARIT-corpus][SARIT library]] with
[[https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch][elasticsearch]].

It presupposes a running instance of elasticsearch, that was fed data
similar to what results from running the XSLT in
https://github.com/paddymcall/Stylesheets/tree/master/profiles/sarit/jsonElastic
on the SARIT library.

bin/plugin install paddymcall/calaca
